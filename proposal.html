<h1>What is your website about?</h1>
    <p>My website will be about weightlifting and gym exercises and stretches.</p>
<h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <p>The objective of my website will be to teach people how to workout with weights in the gym, to recommend how to break up your workouts throughout the week, to teach proper form and to introduce people to a variety of workouts through lessons and instructional videos.</p>
<h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <p>My target audience is anyone who wants to workout to gain muscle or for overall health benefits, or is interested in exercise at any level.</p>
<h4>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website? As you think through your website, please remember that the website must have at least 4 pages of content besides the homepage, sitemap, and contact/feedback pages.</h4>
    <p>I will include a page on the splits of workout days for a given week, another page to show instructions and videos on the exercises described in each day of the workout week, another page to include a section to track your own stats and weights as you complete exercises, and finally a page to suggest stretches and supplements for various types of people and for different benefits.</p>
